# Hr-Dashboard
In this Guided project i have taken a sample HR data of Awesome Chocolate and created a stunning dashboards using Power BI. Some of the steps i performed before building the dashboard are:

◈ Loading data into Power BI and cleaning it with Power Query
◈ Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. leave balance, avg. salary etc. with Power Pivot
◈ Adding columns to the data (like Employee's first name, age group etc.)
◈ Finding relationships between salary and education qualification
◈ Using visual filters to see top / bottom paid staff in each job
◈ Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colours, axis, labels and legend)
◈ Advanced DAX calculations like cumulative headcount, leave balance more than 20 days 

**Project goals**
1) How many people are in each job?
2) Gender break-down of the staff
3) Age spread of the staff
4) Which jobs pay more?
5) Top earners in each job
6) Qualification vs. Salary
